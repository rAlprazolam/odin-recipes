# odin-recipes

In this odin project I will try to meet the criteria stated in on the odin website for the first project which can be found here: [Odin Project: Recipes](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).
I will be only using the html language to accomplish this goal.

## What I learned

In this project I learned the basic language of the web: html. I made a homepage which links to different recipes on cool dishes. I feel now confident working with anchors, links, images, headings, paragraphs and in writing the boilerplate of a html file by myself.
